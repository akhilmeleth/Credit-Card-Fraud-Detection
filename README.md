# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project is about building a fraud detection system using machine learning models. We use the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains transactions labeled as fraud or non-fraud. We will build a neural network, a Random Forest classifier, and a Linear Regression model to detect fraudulent transactions.
Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset is available on Kaggle and contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
